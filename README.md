# Math Game

This game was a Visual Basic project that I created during my sophomore year of high school as part of our computer science program's yearly road show to local elementary schools. The game functions as a sort of "castle defence" concept, where at the end of each round the player is presented with the money they earned and asked to calculate it. The money is displayed in the form of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters, and if the player correctly identifies how much they earned they gain 25% more.

## Installation

The most up to date version of the game can be played by launching the executable in the debug folder. The .vb files can be read to understand how the game functions from a programming standpoint, and files such as the enemies are based off of object oriented programming concepts like inheritance.
